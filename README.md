-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass client is an up-and-coming company that plans to capitalize on a gap in the market for good driver education systems that would help new drivers pass their driving test. The client requested a system to help them manage customer accounts and driving lesson reservations as well as deliver driving education content to their students. They need the system to be easily maintainable and web-based with cloud infrastructure. 

-What did you do particularly well?

In this project, I was able to not only capture the requirements that they had listed but also understand their needs completely so that I could give them a solution that exceeded their expectations. This involved expanding on their initial requirements and creating new functional and non-functional requirements for the project, such as usability requirements and security requirements. 

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I am proud of the diagrams that were created for this project but some of them could have been expanded or reworked to increase readability and expand on system logic to be more descriptive. 

-How did you interpret and implement the user’s needs into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I think it is important to look past just the requests and requirements being asked but to also look at the goals of the client and the overall values. For instance, DriverPass is a smaller company with not many technical employees. That means a solution for them must also be easy to maintain with a smaller, less technical staff. This was never explicitly mentioned by the client, but as a system architect, we must know as much as we can about who we are building these systems for. Even a perfect system cannot be perfect if it isn’t perfect for the client.  

-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software is iterative. I start at a high level and slowly drill down into the details. There must be a cohesive plan, but afterward, each piece needs to be honed and perfected. Breaking something complicated down into smaller pieces makes it much easier to digest. That will be the strategy I use going forward.
